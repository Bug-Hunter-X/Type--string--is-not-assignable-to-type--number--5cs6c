# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch. The `add` function expects two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument. This results in a type error.

The solution involves type checking or type assertion to ensure that the arguments are of the expected type before the addition operation.
